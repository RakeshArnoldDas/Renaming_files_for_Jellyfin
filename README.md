# Renaming_files_for_Jellyfin<div id="header" align="center">


<h2 align="left">Hi, in recent times, I've found myself investing more and more time building out my media server using Jellyfin, but one sore point that we all have to contend with,is the dreaded renaming episodes section.

<h4 align="left">The link to the original material to help with the guidelines that Jellyfin has put together solely for this purpose can be found <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/server/media/shows/">here</a> so here's a small and super light weight terminal based chunk of code that I've put together that 
can do this for you,follow the guide below step by step, and I've been testing it our lately and seems to be working fine on my end.

<h2>
  Step 1: Install Python

<h4 align="left"> You can go ahead and download python from their website, the link is <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a> make sure you grab the correct version for your system. Follow the onscreen prompts and you're good to go.

<h2>
  Step 2: Download the file from Github

<h4 align="left"> Go ahead and download the file from <a href="https://unsplash.com/images/animals/cat">here</a> and save it in a memorable location.


<h2>
  Step 3: Running the code
  
<h4 align="left"> Double click the file and a termianl window should open up, go ahead and enter the season number and hit enter, right click the folder conataining the files and copy as path, you can also go ahead and use the windows shortcut key Cntrl+Shift+C and paste it into the terminal, hit enter and the files should be renamed.
